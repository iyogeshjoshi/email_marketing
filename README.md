# Ways to make sure your promotional email lands to inbox
Here is the lists of all the things to do and NOT to do to make sure your mail is reaching its intented location.

## Checklist
Following is the lists of things to do:
* <dl>
    <dt>Mention By Reader name</dt>
    <dd> This makes things more personal, and the person feels more connected to you and your story.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Welcom Email</dt>
    <dd>Consider using welcome email to ask Gmail subscribers to create a filter that lands your emails in their Primary tab. This is similar to asking subscribers to add you to their **address book** or **"whitelist"** so your messages don't end up in their **SPAM** folder.<br><br>
    If we do this we'have to regularly send from same email address so our emails will pass any filters Gmail users set up.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Traditional Letter Form</dt>
    <dd>By keeping your message simple and natural, it makes the reader feel like you are writing directly to them. It also fools Google.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>No to Images</dt>
    <dd>For whatever reason, Google sees images as a sign of a promotion or spam message. You will increase your readership by not having pictures.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Reduce the number of links</dt>
    <dd>You can get away with more than 1 link, but it’s not guaranteed you will survive the Google filter</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Keep it Short</dt>
    <dd>The longer your email is, the less likely it makes it to Primary.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Send from a Real Person</dt>
    <dd>Emails coming from "real people" i.e., senders with first and last names, more often ends in *Primary tab* then than those coming from brand name.<br><br>
    Keep in mind you can change the name in the "from" field without changing the reply-to email address. </dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Segment of Mass Mailer</dt>
    <dd> The new Gmail traps email marketers in a Catch-22: the same filters it uses to determine that your marketing email is coming from a reputable sender (attached plain text version, physical address included in the footer of your email, etc.) also indicate that your email is coming from a mass sender. Don't use them and you end up in a SPAM filter. Use them, and you're stuck in Promotions tab purgatory.<br><br>
    Personalizing emails with dynamic tags like a first name, including second-person pronouns like "you" and "your," and asking questions in your email subject lines, can land you in the **Updates tab** instead of the *Promotions tab*. While it's still no Primary tab, in the Updates tab your email might be more likely to be seen by consumers expecting a personalized message about order status, billing, etc. It's not like you're pulling the wool over your subscribers' eyes; while these emails may not be transactional, your segmented emails should contain personalized information relevant to the individual. </dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Risky Keywords And size</dt>
    <dd>Limit the use of keywords such as free, buy, promo, prize, bonus, purchase, order etc and try to maintain the size of the email to (30-35kb) also maintain the image to text ratio.</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>It Matters Where You’re “From”</dt>
    <dd>Avoid frequent changes of from field names, avoid obscure From fields, such as "1338asdasd9@domain.com", "noreply@domain.com", use clear, trustworthy From field names, such as: "contact@", "newsletter@", "support@", "feedback@", etc</dd>
  </dl>
* <dl>
    <dt>Stay in Touch!</dt>
    <dd>Sending emails once every two or three months can be more *detrimental* than sending multiple emails *daily*. Why? Your Customers might forget all about you.<br><br>
    If subscribers fail to recognize the From field, they may delete your message, hurting your “open” ratio. Even worse, they may forget signing up for your list and generate negative feedback by marking messages as spam.<br><br>
    There are lots of good reasons for maintaining a steady flow of communication, rather than relying on infrequent, massive “blasts.”</dd>
